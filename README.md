# ðŸš€ Spacey Mission

## Project Overview
**Spacey Mission** is an AI-powered educational platform designed to provide a personalized and engaging learning experience.  

At its core lies a **multi-LLM routing strategy**, where a **central orchestrator LLM** intelligently manages specialized LLMs (like an Explainer, Quiz, and Canvas LLM) to deliver dynamic and interactive content.

The projectâ€™s vision is to create an **adaptive learning environment** with:
- Gamification  
- Progress tracking  
- A user-friendly interface  
- Personalized AI tutor guidance

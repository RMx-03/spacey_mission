# ðŸš€ Spacey Mission

## Project Overview
**Spacey Mission** is an AI-powered educational platform designed to provide a personalized and engaging learning experience. The project is structured as a monorepo to cleanly separate the concerns of the user-facing application, the administrative backend, and the server-side logic.

At its core lies a **multi-LLM routing strategy**, where a **central orchestrator LLM** intelligently manages specialized LLMs (like an Explainer, Quiz, and Canvas LLM) to deliver dynamic and interactive content.

The projectâ€™s vision is to create an **adaptive learning environment** with:
- Gamification
- Progress tracking
- A user-friendly interface
- Personalized AI tutor guidance

## âœ¨ Features
This section outlines the key features of the application, with a checklist to track progress.

### Core Architecture
- [ ] **AI Orchestrator System**: A central LLM that routes user queries to specialized LLMs based on pedagogical needs.
- [ ] **Specialized LLMs**: Dedicated models for explanations, quizzes, Socratic dialogues, and visual aids.
- [ ] **Conditional UI Rendering**: The front-end dynamically renders different components (text, quiz, canvas) based on the AI's response.

### User Experience
- [x] **User Dashboard**: A personalized hub for the user after login.
- [ ] **Proactive Recommendations**: Lessons suggested by the AI based on the userâ€™s progress.
- [ ] **Gamification Hub**: Awards, badges, and leaderboards to motivate users.
- [ ] **Progress & Stats Page**: Analytics with graphs and charts for tracking mastery and time spent.
- [ ] **Lessons Catalog**: A browsable library of all available subjects and lessons.

### Admin & Content Management
- [x] **Admin Dashboard**: A separate, secure application for content management.
- [x] **Lesson Design System**: A visual interface (e.g., node editor, knowledge graph) for creating and structuring lessons.
- [x] **Direct Database Interaction**: Secure endpoints for admins to create, read, update, and delete lesson content.

### Data & Technology
- [ ] **Firebase Firestore Integration**: To store user data, learning paths, and achievements.
- [ ] **Source Document Ingestion**: Backend process to chunk and index educational content for the LLM.
- [x] **User Authentication**: A system for user sign-up and login.
